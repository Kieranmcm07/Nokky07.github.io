        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p>"Far Cry 5" is an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft, set in the fictional Hope County,
          Montana, USA. The game puts players in the role of a deputy sheriff who becomes embroiled in a conflict with a
          fanatical doomsday cult called the Project at Eden's Gate, led by the charismatic and manipulative Joseph
          Seed.

          The gameplay revolves around exploring the vast open world of Hope County, which is divided into three regions
          controlled by Joseph Seed and his siblings, known as "The Heralds." Players have the freedom to roam the
          countryside, forests, and towns, encountering various NPCs, wildlife, and environmental challenges.

          To confront the cult and liberate Hope County, players must complete missions and objectives, which range from
          freeing hostages to destroying cult outposts and gathering resources. As players progress, they recruit allies
          among the local resistance, each with their own skills and abilities to aid in the fight against the cult.

          "Far Cry 5" offers a wide range of activities beyond the main story, including hunting animals for resources,
          fishing in rivers and lakes, and participating in various side missions and challenges. The game also
          introduces a dynamic "Resistance Meter," which reflects the player's progress in destabilizing the cult's
          control over each region.

          In addition to the single-player campaign, "Far Cry 5" features cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to
          team up with friends to tackle missions and explore the open world together. The game also includes an
          expansive map editor called "Far Cry Arcade," where players can create and share their own custom maps and
          scenarios.

          With its stunning visuals, immersive open world, and engaging gameplay mechanics, "Far Cry 5" offers players a
          rich and captivating experience as they work to liberate Hope County from the grip of the Project at Eden's
          Gate.</p>
