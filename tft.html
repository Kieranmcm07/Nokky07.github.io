          <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
          <p>TFT is a round-based strategy game developed by Riot Games and contains the characters and items from
            League of Legends. Within TFT, eight players compete against each other until there is one winner left.By
            combining critical thinking and the element of chance, TFT allows players to use their imagination and
            creativity to draft a unique team and fight to be the last one standing.</p>

          <h4><u>Different Gamemodes</u></h4>
          <p>TFT features couple of different gamemodes which changes the way that player has to think about creating
            their team.<br><br> <h4><u>Normal mode</u></h4><p> Normal mode is as the name says a plain TFT gameplay where player buys champions builds
            a team that matches emblems on each champion build items that then you put on each champion level up in
            order to have higher chances for better champions and to increase your team capacity.<br><br> <h4><u>Ranked</u></h4><p> is same
            as normal but it features rank system which goes from Iron up to hghest rank which is Challanger.<br><br>
            <h4><u>Double up (Workshop)</u></h4><p> Is same as gamemodes mentioned before except you have another person playing in your
            team, you won't fight against person in your team and you can give each other champions and if one person
            finishes a fight quicker then they teleport to their teammate and help them fight.<br><br> Hyper roll is the
            same except the level system works different, players dont spend their gold on level except they level up
            over time with each stage which helps to focus on team building more.</p>
