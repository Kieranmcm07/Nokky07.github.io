        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p>Rocket League is a dynamic blend of soccer and vehicular mayhem. Players control customizable rocket-powered
          cars, zooming around an arena to hit a giant ball into their opponents' goal. The game offers a variety of
          modes, including traditional 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and chaotic 4v4 matches, as well as alternate modes like hoops
          (basketball) and hockey.

          Beyond the core gameplay, Rocket League features an extensive customization system, allowing players to
          personalize their cars with various body types, decals, paint finishes, wheels, and rocket boosts. This
          customization not only adds a layer of personalization but also allows players to stand out on the field.

          Rocket League's competitive scene is also noteworthy, with players competing in ranked matches to climb the
          leaderboards and showcase their skills. The game has gained traction as an esport, hosting tournaments with
          significant prize pools and a dedicated fan base.

          Moreover, Psyonix, the developer behind Rocket League, continuously supports the game with updates,
          introducing new arenas, game modes, cosmetic items, and features to keep the experience fresh for players.
          This commitment to ongoing development has contributed to the game's enduring popularity since its release.
