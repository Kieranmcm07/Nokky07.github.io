        <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
        <p>Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game created by Markus "Notch" Persson and developed and published
          by Mojang Studios. It was initially released in 2011 and has since become one of the best-selling video
          games of all time, with versions available on various platforms including PC, consoles, and mobile
          devices.</p>

        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world, where they can gather resources,
          craft tools and items, build structures, and interact with the environment and other players. The game
          offers different modes, including Survival mode, where players must gather resources and maintain their
          health and hunger, Creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and can build freely, and
          Adventure mode, which allows for custom maps and scenarios created by players.
          Minecraft has a vast and dedicated community that has created countless mods, custom maps, and mini-games,
          further expanding the possibilities within the game. Its open-ended nature and creative potential have
          made it immensely popular among players of all ages around the world.</p>
