        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p>"Battlefield 4," launched in 2013, marked another milestone in the franchise's legacy, offering an engaging
          mix of single-player and multiplayer experiences.

          In the single-player campaign, players assume the role of Sergeant Daniel Recker, a member of the elite U.S.
          Special Forces squad known as Tombstone. The narrative unfolds in the midst of a global crisis sparked by
          rising tensions between the United States, China, and Russia. As Recker and his squad navigate through a
          series of missions across various locales, they uncover a conspiracy that threatens to plunge the world into
          chaos. The campaign is characterized by its cinematic storytelling, intense firefights, and stunning
          set-pieces, showcasing the scale and spectacle of modern warfare.

          However, it's the multiplayer component where "Battlefield 4" truly shines. Supporting up to 64 players on PC
          and consoles, multiplayer offers an expansive sandbox experience with diverse gameplay modes. The signature
          Conquest mode sees teams battling for control of key objectives across vast, open maps, while Team Deathmatch
          provides fast-paced infantry combat. Other modes like Rush, Domination, and Obliteration offer varied
          objectives and challenges, ensuring there's something for every type of player.

          The game introduces "Levolution," a dynamic feature that allows players to alter the battlefield during
          matches. This includes events such as collapsing buildings, flooding streets, and triggering landslides, which
          not only change the layout of the map but also impact gameplay strategies.

          "Battlefield 4" also emphasizes teamwork and player customization. Players can choose from four distinct
          classes—Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon—each with its own unique weapons, gadgets, and abilities. Team
          coordination is crucial, whether it's repairing vehicles, providing cover fire, or executing coordinated
          assaults on enemy positions.

          Visually, "Battlefield 4" is stunning, thanks to the Frostbite 3 engine, which delivers highly detailed
          environments, realistic animations, and immersive sound design. From the urban sprawl of Shanghai to the
          frozen landscapes of Siberia, each map is a visually stunning and dynamic playground for players to explore
          and conquer.

          While "Battlefield 4" faced some technical issues at launch, including server instability and bugs, DICE
          worked diligently to address these concerns through post-launch updates and patches. Over time, the game
          evolved into a polished and highly praised multiplayer experience, earning it a dedicated fan base and
          cementing its status as a standout entry in the Battlefield series.</p>
