        <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
        <p>
          "Garry's Mod" is a sandbox physics game developed by Facepunch Studios. It provides players with tools and
          assets from various Source Engine games to create and manipulate scenarios and environments. Players can
          explore their creativity, experiment with physics, and engage in multiplayer activities such as building,
          role-playing, and mini-games. The game supports extensive user-created content, allowing players to download
          mods, maps, and other assets created by the community. With its open-ended gameplay and emphasis on creative
          expression, "Garry's Mod" offers a unique and customizable gaming experience.</p>

        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p>
          "Garry's Mod" is a sandbox game developed by Facepunch Studios and initially released in 2006. It is built
          upon Valve Corporation's Source Engine, which powers several popular titles like "Half-Life 2,"
          "Counter-Strike: Source," and "Team Fortress 2." While "Garry's Mod" originated as a modification for
          "Half-Life 2," it later became a standalone game available for purchase on Steam.

          The game offers players an open-ended and highly customizable experience. Instead of following a linear
          storyline or completing predefined objectives, players are given access to a wide range of tools, props, and
          assets from various Source Engine games. These tools allow players to manipulate objects, experiment with
          physics, and create their own content within the game world.

          One of the key features of "Garry's Mod" is its extensive support for user-created content. Players can
          download and install mods, maps, models, and other assets created by the community. This vast repository of
          user-generated content significantly expands the game's possibilities, enabling players to create anything
          from elaborate structures to complex contraptions.

          The game's multiplayer component is another major aspect of its appeal. Players can join servers hosted by
          others or create their own servers, where they can interact with friends or strangers online. Multiplayer
          modes range from cooperative building and exploration to competitive mini-games and role-playing scenarios.

          "Garry's Mod" has also become a popular platform for creative expression. Players can use the in-game tools
          and assets to produce machinima (animated movies using game assets), create artwork, design custom game modes,
          and even develop their own games using Lua scripting.

          Overall, "Garry's Mod" offers a unique blend of sandbox gameplay, creative freedom, and multiplayer
          interaction. Its open-ended nature and robust modding community ensure that players always have new
          experiences to explore and create within its virtual sandbox.</p>
