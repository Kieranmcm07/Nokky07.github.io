          <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
          <p>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which the player controls a character
            ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric perspective. As of 2023, there are over 160
            champions available to play. Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points
            (XP) through killing enemies. Items can be acquired to increase champions' strength, and are bought with
            gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions,
            champions, or defensive structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a
            shop menu available to players only when their champion is in the team's base. Each match is discrete;
            levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.</p>


          <h1><u>League of Legends Gamemodes</u></h1>
          <p>League of Legends has many gamemodes, most are event gamemodes that are made for fun and for players to
            enjoy funny parts of each gamemode.<br><br><div class="leg"><h3>Main gamemodes are:</h3></div><h4><u>Summoner’s Rift</u></h4><p>

            The experience most everyone thinks of when they imagine playing League of Legends is found on Summoner’s
            Rift. Two teams of five players match up across three lanes and a broad jungle to battle it out for
            experience and gold. These resources enable players to level up their champions and purchase valuable items
            that improve their fighting potential.

            The goal is to break down the defensive turrets that protect the enemy’s base, and then to invade that base
            and destroy the enemy nexus. Games can be short, or they can run up to around an hour if the two teams are
            particularly well-matched.<br><br>
           <h4><u> ARAM</u></h4><p>

            Also featuring two teams of five, ARAM is a simpler and more straightforward game mode. Five players on each
            team march their way down a single, unified lane in this game mode. The goal is still to gain experience and
            gold in order to power up one’s champions, but there are far fewer strategic concerns because the
            single-lane mechanic is so straightforward.Eventually, ARAM also requires players to disable enemy defensive
            turrets and to eventually destroy the enemy nexus.<br><br>
            <h4><u>Arena</u></h4><p>

            A newer featured game mode is the Multi-Team Arena mode. This mode sees players battle it out in teams of
            two. Four such teams compete in a tighter playing field in this scrambling brawl.

            Arena has a much different feel compared to Summoner’s Rift and ARAM, eschewing the lane mechanic entirely
            to create what feels almost like a different game. This mode has been a breath of fresh air for many League
            of Legends players, and developer Riot Games seems committed to making it work for those players.
