      <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
      <p>CS2 is a newest Counter-Strike series game which compared to previous versions has upgraded graphics and
        different mechanics such as volumetrical smokes, different recoil patterns or features such as being able to
        drop grenades, new game length system: in stead of short matches (16 rounds) and long matches (30 rounds) now
        there is only option to play a 24 round match which if ends up with score 12-12 will result in rematch which is
        played for another 6 rounds with maximum amount of money and with team switch after first half instead of game
        ending up on a draw as in previous versions.</p>

      <h4><u>CS2 Events</u></h4>
      <p>
        CS2 has its own special events such as IEM or Major that happen only once per year. Before each event team's
        qualify for it and have to play against each other in qualification stage which will result in them either
        getting
        eliminated or qualifying which will allows them to take part in x event. Major is the biggest Counter-Strike
        event
        since the game came out, only best of the best qualify where after the initial seeded match, teams play five
        rounds against randomly drawn teams with the same record. No two teams play twice unless necessary. If a team
        wins
        three matches, then that team moves on to the next stage. If a team loses three matches, that team is
        eliminated.
        Each team is only allowed to lose 2 matches and then if they want to qualify they need to win 3 matches without
        losing. Next stage involves Legends stage where all teams that qualified play against each other till two teams
        are left and whoever wins get's the trophy and Major Winner status. There is also another award for anyone that
        has the best statistics such as K/D/A (Kill/Death/Assist) ratio in the whole event. Person that is chosen for it
        gains MVP award and is considered as the best player in the entire event even if their team lost a match.</p>
