        <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
        <p>Rust is a multiplayer survival game where players must gather resources, build shelters, and fend off threats
          from both other players and the environment.</p>

        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p> In Rust, players start with minimal resources and find themselves stranded on an island filled with harsh
          environmental conditions, wildlife, and other players. The main objective is survival, which involves
          gathering resources such as wood, stone, and metal to build shelters, craft tools, and hunt animals for food.

          Base building is a significant aspect of the game, as players construct fortified bases to protect themselves
          and their loot from other players. Bases can range from simple wooden shelters to elaborate structures made of
          metal, offering varying degrees of protection and security.

          The game features both player versus player (PvP) and player versus environment (PvE) elements. While players
          can form alliances and work together, they must also be wary of other players who may attack them for
          resources or territory. Additionally, the game's environment presents challenges such as radiation zones,
          harsh weather conditions, and aggressive wildlife that players must contend with.

          Rust has a progression system where players can research and craft advanced items and weapons. Researching new
          technologies requires finding and using rare resources and components, adding depth to the gameplay and
          encouraging exploration.

          The game world of Rust is dynamic, with servers regularly wiping to reset the game world and force players to
          start anew. This ensures that gameplay remains fresh and unpredictable, as players must adapt to new
          environments and challenges with each wipe cycle.

          Overall, Rust offers a challenging and immersive survival experience that emphasizes player interaction,
          resource management, base building, and strategic gameplay in a hostile and unforgiving world. Its combination
          of PvP and PvE elements, dynamic world, and progression system have made it a popular choice among fans of the
          survival genre.</p>
