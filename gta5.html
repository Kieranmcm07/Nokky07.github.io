          <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
          <p>"Grand Theft Auto V" (GTA V) is set in the sprawling fictional state of San Andreas, which encompasses the
            vibrant city of Los Santos and its surrounding countryside and desert areas. The game introduces players to
            three distinct protagonists, each with their own unique background, personality, and motivations.

            Michael De Santa is a retired bank robber living under witness protection, yearning for the excitement of
            his criminal past while struggling with familial issues. He deals with a dysfunctional family life,
            including a strained relationship with his wife Amanda, rebellious daughter Tracy, and lazy son Jimmy.

            Franklin Clinton is a young and ambitious street hustler looking to escape his life of crime in the
            impoverished neighborhood of Strawberry. He becomes involved with Michael after a chance encounter, seeing
            him as a mentor figure. Franklin seeks to rise above his circumstances and make a name for himself in the
            criminal underworld.

            Trevor Philips is an unhinged and psychotic career criminal who operates out of a trailer park in the desert
            town of Sandy Shores. A former associate of Michael's, Trevor harbors deep resentment towards him and
            embodies chaos and violence, embracing a reckless and unpredictable lifestyle.

            As players progress through the game, they switch between these three protagonists, each offering a unique
            perspective on the events unfolding in Los Santos. The narrative revolves around the trio's involvement in a
            series of increasingly audacious heists orchestrated by Michael's former partner, Lester Crest.

            In addition to the main storyline, players can explore the vast open world of San Andreas, engaging in a
            wide array of activities including driving, flying, shooting, and participating in various side missions and
            mini-games. The game also features an online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online, allowing players to
            team up with friends, engage in cooperative missions, and compete in various multiplayer modes and
            activities.

            GTA V received widespread critical acclaim upon its release in 2013, praised for its expansive open-world
            environment, engaging narrative, diverse gameplay mechanics, and attention to detail. It quickly became one
            of the best-selling video games of all time, cementing the Grand Theft Auto series as a cultural phenomenon
            in the gaming industry.</p>

          <h4><u>Lore of Grand Theft Auto V</u></h4>
          <p>The lore of "Grand Theft Auto V" (GTA V) revolves around the intertwining stories of three protagonists:
            Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton, and Trevor Philips. Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, primarily
            focusing on the city of Los Santos, the game explores themes of crime, wealth, corruption, and the pursuit
            of the American Dream.

            Michael De Santa is a retired bank robber living under witness protection. Despite his wealth, he finds
            himself discontented with his family life and yearning for the adrenaline rush of his criminal past.
            Franklin Clinton, on the other hand, is a street-savvy hustler looking for a way out of the gang life in the
            neighborhood of Strawberry. The two cross paths, leading Franklin to become involved in Michael's schemes.

            Trevor Philips, a volatile and unhinged career criminal, is Michael's former partner who believes Michael
            betrayed him during a botched robbery years earlier. Trevor's erratic behavior and propensity for violence
            add a chaotic element to the storyline.

            The trio's narratives intertwine as they engage in various criminal activities, including heists
            orchestrated by Lester Crest, a skilled hacker and planner. As they pursue wealth and power, they also
            navigate personal struggles and conflicts within their relationships and identities.

            Throughout the game, players encounter a colorful cast of characters, from corrupt government officials to
            ambitious criminals, reflecting the seedy underbelly of Los Santos. The city serves as a playground for the
            protagonists' criminal exploits, with its sprawling urban landscape offering countless opportunities for
            mayhem and mischief.

            GTA V's lore delves into the complexities of the modern American landscape, critiquing consumerism,
            celebrity culture, and the disparity between the wealthy elite and those struggling to get by. The game's
            narrative is punctuated by heists, shootouts, and car chases, all set against the backdrop of a meticulously
            crafted open-world environment filled with satire and social commentary.

            Overall, the lore of GTA V presents a compelling and immersive experience that explores the darker aspects
            of contemporary society while providing players with the freedom to carve out their own path in the criminal
            underworld of Los Santos.</p>
