          Combat has been refined and expanded, offering more options for engaging with the various threats that inhabit
          the forest. Players can choose between stealthy takedowns, ranged attacks, or all-out confrontations, each
          approach carrying its own risks and rewards.

          Multiplayer also returns in "Sons of the Forest," allowing players to team up with friends or strangers to
          tackle the challenges of the forest together. Cooperative play adds an extra layer of strategy and camaraderie
