        <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
        <p>
          "Ghost of Tsushima" is an immersive open-world action-adventure game set in the late 13th century during the
          first Mongol invasion of Japan. Here's a more detailed overview:

          Setting: The game is set on the island of Tsushima, a lush and diverse landscape inspired by real-world
          locations in Japan. The island serves as the battleground between the invading Mongol army, led by the
          ruthless Khotun Khan, and the defenders, primarily the samurai warriors of Tsushima.

          Protagonist: Players assume the role of Jin Sakai, a skilled samurai and one of the few survivors of the
          initial Mongol invasion. As Jin, players navigate the moral complexities of war as he grapples with the
          traditional samurai code of honor and the necessity of adopting new, less honorable tactics to defeat the
          invaders.

          Gameplay: The gameplay combines elements of action, exploration, stealth, and combat. Players have the freedom
          to explore Tsushima's expansive open-world environment, which features lush forests, rolling hills, serene
          shrines, and war-torn villages. Exploration is rewarded with hidden collectibles, side quests, and
          opportunities to learn more about Japanese culture.

          Combat: Combat in "Ghost of Tsushima" emphasizes precision and skill, drawing inspiration from traditional
          samurai swordplay. Players engage in intense sword fights against Mongol warriors using a variety of
          techniques, including quick strikes, parries, dodges, and special moves. As players progress, they can unlock
          new abilities and stances to adapt to different enemy types and combat situations.

          Stealth: In addition to direct combat, players can employ stealth tactics to infiltrate enemy strongholds and
          ambush unsuspecting foes. Jin can utilize his surroundings to remain hidden, assassinate enemies silently, and
          create distractions to thin out enemy ranks before engaging in direct combat.

          Visuals and Presentation: "Ghost of Tsushima" is renowned for its stunning visuals, attention to detail, and
          immersive presentation. The game's art direction captures the beauty of feudal Japan, from its serene
          landscapes to its intricately designed architecture and costumes. Dynamic weather and lighting effects further
          enhance the game's atmosphere, creating breathtaking vistas and immersive environments.

          Narrative: The game's narrative explores themes of honor, sacrifice, and the nature of heroism in times of
          war. As Jin embarks on his quest to liberate Tsushima, he must confront difficult choices and moral dilemmas
          that challenge his identity as a samurai and force him to question the traditional values he once held dear.

          Reception: "Ghost of Tsushima" received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, praised for its
          captivating storyline, engaging gameplay, and stunning visuals. The game's depiction of Japanese culture and
          history was particularly well-received, earning praise for its authenticity and attention to detail. "Ghost of
          Tsushima" is considered one of the standout titles of the PlayStation 4 generation and has garnered a
          dedicated fanbase worldwide.</p>
