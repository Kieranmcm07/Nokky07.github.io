            American Dream. Niko's journey is marked by moral ambiguity as he confronts the consequences of his actions
            and grapples with the choices he must make to survive in a city where violence and corruption are rampant.

            Throughout the game, players uncover various subplots and hidden connections between characters, adding
            depth to the lore of Liberty City and providing insight into the motivations driving its inhabitants.

            Overall, the lore of GTA IV is rich and multifaceted, offering players a compelling narrative experience set
