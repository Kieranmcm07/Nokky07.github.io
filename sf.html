      <h4><u>Summary</u></h4>
      <p>
        Street Fighter is a legendary series of fighting video games developed and published by Capcom. It has been a
        cornerstone of the fighting game genre since its inception in 1987. The gameplay typically revolves around
        one-on-one combat between characters from various backgrounds and fighting styles.

        The core gameplay mechanics of Street Fighter involve players controlling characters who engage in
        hand-to-hand combat with opponents. Players execute a variety of martial arts moves, special attacks, and
        combos using a combination of joystick movements and button inputs. Each character has a unique set of attacks
        and abilities, including signature special moves and super combos.

        The series is known for its iconic characters, such as Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, and Guile, each with their own
        distinct fighting styles and personalities. Over the years, the roster of characters has expanded
        significantly, with each new installment introducing new fighters alongside returning favorites.

        Street Fighter tournaments and competitions have become popular worldwide, attracting skilled players and
        showcasing high-level gameplay. The competitive scene has led to the development of advanced strategies,
        techniques, and mind games, making Street Fighter not only entertaining to play but also compelling to watch.

        Street Fighter has also spawned various spin-offs, sequels, and adaptations across different platforms,
        including arcade machines, home consoles, and even animated series and movies. Its influence on the gaming
        industry and pop culture at large is undeniable, cementing its status as one of the most iconic and beloved
        video game franchises of all time.</p>

      <h4><u>More Detail</u></h4>
      <p>
        Street Fighter is a seminal series in the fighting game genre, renowned for its rich history, diverse cast of
        characters, and enduring legacy. Developed by Capcom, the franchise has evolved significantly since its
        inception in 1987, setting standards for competitive fighting games and influencing countless titles across
        multiple generations of gaming platforms.

        The gameplay of Street Fighter typically involves one-on-one battles between characters, each with their own
        unique fighting style and special moves. Players control their chosen character, executing attacks, combos,
        and special moves to deplete their opponent's health bar within a set time limit. Victory is achieved by
        either reducing the opponent's health to zero or having more health remaining when time expires.

        Central to the mechanics of Street Fighter is its control scheme, which combines directional inputs with
        button presses to execute various attacks. Different combinations of inputs result in different moves, from
        basic punches and kicks to powerful special attacks known as "Hadokens," "Shoryukens," and "Spinning Bird
        Kicks." Mastering these moves and understanding the intricacies of timing, spacing, and counterplay are
        crucial for success in the game.

        The series is renowned for its iconic characters, many of whom have become cultural icons in their own right.
        Characters like Ryu and Ken, with their classic karate-inspired movesets, have become synonymous with the
        franchise. Other notable characters include Chun-Li, the first playable female fighter in a mainstream
        fighting game; Guile, known for his powerful charge-based moves; and Akuma, a formidable fighter with dark,
        mysterious powers.

        Street Fighter's competitive scene has been a driving force behind the series' enduring popularity. Since the
        early days of arcade gaming, players have gathered to compete in tournaments, showcase their skills, and
        establish themselves as top contenders in the fighting game community. Street Fighter tournaments, such as the
        Evolution Championship Series (EVO), have become premier events in the esports world, attracting players from
        around the globe and offering substantial prize pools.

        Over the years, the Street Fighter series has seen numerous iterations and sequels, each introducing new
        characters, gameplay mechanics, and graphical enhancements. Street Fighter II, released in 1991, is often
        credited with popularizing the fighting game genre and is considered one of the greatest video games of all
        time. Subsequent titles, including Street Fighter III, Street Fighter IV, and Street Fighter V, have continued
        to push the boundaries of the series while staying true to its core principles.

        Beyond video games, Street Fighter has expanded into other forms of media, including animated series, comic
        books, and feature films. Its characters and universe have become ingrained in popular culture, inspiring fan
        art, cosplay, and merchandise.

        Overall, Street Fighter remains a cornerstone of gaming history, cherished by fans for its deep gameplay,
        memorable characters, and enduring impact on the world of video games.</p>
